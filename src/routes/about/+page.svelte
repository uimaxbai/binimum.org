        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
          Binimum was founded in 2023 by a group of individuals who recognized that modern life had become overwhelmed with excessâ€”excess possessions, excess information, excess commitments, and excess stress.
        </p>
        <p>
          Drawing inspiration from various minimalist philosophies and spiritual practices that emphasize simplicity, we developed the Binimum approach: a practical philosophy that helps people identify and maintain only what is truly necessary for a meaningful life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unlike extreme minimalism that can feel restrictive, Binimum acknowledges that each person's "minimum" is unique. We don't prescribe a specific number of possessions or rigid rules. Instead, we provide principles and practices that help you discover your own personal "bare minimum" that supports your well-being and purpose.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
          At Binimum, we're committed to helping people reclaim their time, space, and mental clarity by embracing the bare minimum. We believe that by removing the unnecessary, we create room for what truly matters: meaningful relationships, personal growth, and contributing positively to our communities and planet.
        </p>
